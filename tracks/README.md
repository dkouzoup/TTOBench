# Track library

## Content

- [This table](tracks.csv) summarizes the collected benchmark instances and some of their properties

- The `Source` column specifies how the track data were acquired
    - `P`: public data (already in digital form)
    - `D`: described data (e.g., text or table in public document)
    - `I`: illustrated data (digitalization of publicly available figure)

- Data acquired via digitalization are subject to large approximation errors with respect to their souce

- The `References` column contains a non-exhaustive list of publications using each benchmark instance
